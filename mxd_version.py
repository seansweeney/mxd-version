# Find all the MXD files in a folder and print out their ArcGIS Desktop version

# The primary function (getMXDVersion) was stolen verbatim from https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/142689/335

# Beware: the answer on that post that is marked as correct does not work from ArcGIS 10.4 on.  This one
# has been tested through 10.5.1.
#
# This has been tested in Python 2.7 and 3.5, so it should work whether or not you have ArcGIS Pro/Python 3.x
# Installed and messing up your Python environment.
